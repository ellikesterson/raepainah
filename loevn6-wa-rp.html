                            <p> My friends and I were on a Minecraft server and I was roleplaying as a priest, and called everyone in our town to the church for a service (ive been to church so i sorta know how it goes down) and was planning on replacing some of the biblical lore with the server lore (characters, story mixups, etc). My catholic friend told me i shouldnt do that because its offensive, and that if i wanted to do that I had to use the bible itself and had to be catholic. AITA because i told him i could Hi there! I'm looking for a group keen on exploring some of the new Ravnica content coming out this month. As for me, I have only been playing D&D for a few months now but have picked things up pretty quickly. I'd really love to find a group interested in / engaged with the roleplay side of things. Ideally I'd love to join something bi-weekly (although weekly might not be out of the question depending on the location). Evenings and weekends are usually the most flexible Hey guys, I was on a WoW binge fest on YouTube and I came across a channel called PixelCat. It features some light trolling and exploration of the Moon Guard RP server on retail. I think I have deduced that the Moon Guard server is notorious for ERP (Erotic Role Play) and so his videos do heavily feature the inn at Goldshire and the sexual nature of some WoW characters. Another video of his features a pair of cushion sellers in Stormwind. They are horrible sellers. They have cushions My current stat: After playing this character for this long and learning a lot more about this game than when I first started recently, I am at a point where I need to decide if I truly want to be a holy paladin. I have a choice: I can get my faith to 40 and that will give my holy cleric. OR, I can get my luck to 40 and that will give a Black Knight (?) or at least that's what I think would happen (either that or the Hex lady I rescued from the jail, which I think. 
Would it be an ideal world to you? Would gender roles closely resemble those of 50+ years ago? If every man was an alpha shooting for a HB9, what would become of all the lesser wenches?

Sometimes riot gives us some extra RP when we purchase Riot Points. When were the last time they had this bonus and can we expect it soon again?

I jsut bought a hacked psp and I wanted to add the other gba psp emulators. What are the latest versions and where can I get them? Thank. TL;DR - I'm new to the RedPillWomen sub, freshly out of lurkdom, and wrote this post as a sort of encouragement to my fellow lurkers and newbies. It's a little bit of history and a little bit about my recent changes, but I'm not writing this for you to get to know me. I'm writing because I was always a "smart girl" and when I found RP, I quickly thought I had it all figured out. Swallowing the red pill made me feel special. I was enlightened and everything was going to get better. It was a great. Hello, once again.
