                            <p> Hi everyone, amp#x200B; I am taking a course on Software Engineering for which lectures have ended already this semester. It felt like most of the material discussed was theoretical in nature and not practical to Software Engineering work. I have assembled three lists consisting of topics that I thought were useful, topics that didn't seem useful, and topics that I would have liked to learn about. amp#x200B; Topics that I thought were useful: Scrum Version Control Git Delta. I am a 5th year Mechanical Engineering student and I am going to take a CFD course next semester. I would also like to learn FEA, is it possible to self-learn this? What resources are available for me to advantage on? Thanks! EDIT: Wow I got so many responses in this thread! I was not expecting this many. Thanks everyone! Now I got more resources and information than I can handle. Hi all. I am a recent graduate (BS in computer engineering). I currently work as a software engineer and do not enjoy the work. I took the first job offer I got and ran with it (because it was a long and stressful search). I have been working here for a few months and am looking to leave because I dread doing software development work (my internships in school were in this area) and am not learning any new technologies that would help in a career in software engineering. I also enjoy low level. I'm currently a college student and am looking for good free software that can aid me in mapping out and planning a software project in a team based setting. I'm really looking for software that allows me to make detailed tasks, schedule them, make various software engineering diagrams, etc. Any suggestions for quality software that is free or cheap (preferably free) would be much appreciated. What if I could build and train a system to find music legal to use commercially https://medium.com/@aimvec/building-a-music-finder-with-golang-apache-couchdb-and-rabbitmq-1-a8ecc73a3081 (https://medium.com/@aimvec/building-a-music-finder-with-golang-apache-couchdb-and-rabbitmq-1-a8ecc73a3081). 
Hello comrades, I've been tasked to set up an authorization server to take care of SSH-logins. Right now, we put the public ssh keys of our employees into the authorized_keys file by hand. Obviously, that's not a great idea and leads to a lot of chaos with over a hundred servers across our organization. We're continually moving stuff to ansible so that would be a semi-automated option, but I'd prefer to have a single (later two, for redundancy) server take care of authorization. I've looked. Hi all, I recently interviewed for a data engineering position and it went horrible and incredibly awakward (phone interview), especially when the interviewer told me she had the wrong resume, then tried to look for it and couldn’t find it. She asked if i had a degree in Data Mining and oriented objective design, since I got my degree in Stats, i was a bit familiar with data mining but Oriented objective design sounded more like CS to me so i had told her i wasn’t familiar This subreddit is rather large and we have a plethora of ideas for aero or lack there of. Any enterprising fans have CAD and/or CFD models to do rough tests. Yes, I am basically loving the idea of STABILITY and knowing that things will function RELIABLY. 28 years old with a degree in what's essentially technical art. I'll try to keep my background short: I used to be a 3D artist, was tolerant of the work, but hated the pay and general instability. So with a combination of effort and luck, I made a career switch to software engineering for the money and job security. I knew it was going to be challenging at first, but most people assured me that I'd "get it" eventually and settle in. This isn't even close to happening and I don't think Hi. how many people are needed to design a softcore cpu from the group up? Include the whole software stack and FPGA parts? thanks Peter. Please post the job with the following template: Company Name Title(s) of position(s) being hired for City, State/Province, Country {ONSITE, REMOTE} {Full Time, Part Time, Contract} (Optional) $approximate salary description contact information Posters: Please only post if you are personally involved in the hiring party -- no 3rd party recruiters (you must post the name of the company) Readers: please only email submitters if you personally are interested. As the question says. I am thinking about roles at trad engineering companies (building rail, roads, structures), not engineering as used at silicon valley. If your example build only software, this question is not directed at you. Most engineers I know have come up through the university route (practically necessary for chartership in my generation). Most of the cad/BIM technicians I know have come up through formal apprenticeships. Coding, especially at the level we see in an trad company. I have been using nextcloud for a while and the only thing that concerns me is the language, otherwise is a more than great tool (a gift actually). So I am a lot cautious about PHP nowadays as it's outdated (not going to debate this in this post) and I could prefer something more friendly to modern scripting languages e.g. Python, Ruby, JS. Is there something similar out there. 
Hi there. I am considering signing up for a coding bootcamp. Does anyone have any insight as to what type of bootcamp is the best? Is it worth it? What is the best way to get started in the world of coding. </p>
